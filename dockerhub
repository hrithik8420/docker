Docker Push Image to Docker Hub

### **Step 1: Login to Docker Hub**

```bash
docker login
```

* Enter your Docker Hub username and password.
* Successful login allows you to push images.

### **Step 2: Tag your image**

Docker Hub requires the image name to include your username.

```bash
docker tag <local_image_name>:<tag> <dockerhub_username>/<repository_name>:<tag>
```

* Example:

```bash
docker tag myapp:latest hri123/myapp:latest
```

### **Step 3: Push image to Docker Hub**

```bash
docker push <dockerhub_username>/<repository_name>:<tag>
```

* Example:

```bash
docker push hri123/myapp:latest
```

* The image will be uploaded to your Docker Hub repository.

### **Step 4: Verify**

* Check on Docker Hub web interface under your repositories.
* Or list images locally:

```bash
docker images
```

### **Tips:**

* Always tag images with meaningful names and versions.
* Use `latest` tag for the most recent build.
* Ensure you are logged in before pushing.
* Private repositories require Docker Hub account with permissions.
